### 4. Dockerfile for Cloud Run (`Dockerfile`)

This file contains the instructions to build a container image for your application. Cloud Run uses this image to run your app in a scalable way.

```Dockerfile
# Use an official lightweight Python image.
# Using python:3.9-slim helps to keep the container size small.
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container.
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container.
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the Python dependencies.
# The --no-cache-dir option reduces the image size.
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application's source code into the container.
# This includes app.py and data.csv.
COPY . .

# Tell the container to listen on port 8080 for incoming connections.
# Cloud Run will automatically use this port.
EXPOSE 8080

# Define the command to run the application using gunicorn.
# This is the standard way to run a production WSGI app like Dash.
# It binds the server to port 8080 and points to the 'server' object inside the 'app.py' file.
CMD ["gunicorn", "-b", ":8080", "app:server"]
