*   `-b :$PORT`: Binds Gunicorn to the host and port specified by the `$PORT` environment variable. Cloud Run automatically provides this variable. **You must not hardcode a port number.**
*   `app:server`: Tells Gunicorn to look inside the `app.py` file (the `app` module) for the variable named `server` (which is your WSGI-compatible app).
