Physical Activity Tracker - README
===============================

Description
-----------
This is a Python web application built with Plotly Dash and Dash Bootstrap Components to visualize weekly physical activity data. Users can upload a CSV file containing their daily steps and calories burned, and the application will generate interactive charts and provide simple, text-based insights.

The application is designed with a dark theme and is ready for deployment on Google Cloud Run.

Features
--------
- Dark Theme: Uses the "Darkly" theme from Dash Bootstrap Components for a sleek, modern look.
- Two-Page Layout:
    1. Dashboard: Main page for data upload and visualization.
    2. Insights: A second page providing smart recommendations based on recent activity.
- Interactive Charts:
    - A line chart to visualize daily step trends.
    - A bar chart to display daily calories burned.
- File Upload: Allows users to upload their own activity data via a CSV file. The charts update automatically upon successful upload.
- Empty State: The dashboard shows a prompt to upload a file when no data is loaded.
- Smart Recommendations: The "Insights" page analyzes the last two days of data and provides a simple, motivational message.
- Responsive Design: Built with Dash Bootstrap Components (Cards, Navbar) to ensure the layout is clean and works well on different screen sizes.
- Ready for Deployment: Includes a Gunicorn server instance, making it suitable for deployment on platforms like Google Cloud Run.
