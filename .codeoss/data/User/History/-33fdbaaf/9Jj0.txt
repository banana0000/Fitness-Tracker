How to Deploy to Google Cloud Run
---------------------------------
(Assuming you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and configured)

1.  **Place Files:**
    Ensure `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `Procfile` are in the same directory.

2.  **Deploy Command:**
    Open your terminal in the project directory and run the following command. Replace `[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]` and `[YOUR_APP_NAME]` with your specific details.
    ```
    gcloud run deploy [YOUR_APP_NAME] --source . --region [YOUR_REGION] --project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] --allow-unauthenticated
    ```
    Follow the on-screen prompts from the Google Cloud SDK to complete the deployment. Once finished, it will provide you with a public URL to access your live application.
